Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to
    post auction listings,
    comment on those listings,
    and add listings to a "watchlist".

User class (which inherits from AbstractUser) already has fields for
    username,
    email,
    password,
    etc.,
    (add more if needed)

Need models to represent
    auction listings,
    bids,
    comments,
    auction categories (optional) (e.g. Fashion, Toys, Electronics, Home, etc.)

CREATE LISTINGS
    Users should be able to visit a page to create a new listing
    They should be able to specify
        a title for the listing
        a text-based description
        the starting bid
    Optional fields for
        image URL
        category

ACTIVE LISTINGS PAGE
    Is the default landing route
    For each active listing, show
        the title,
        description,
        current price,
        and photo (if is existent)

LISTING PAGE
    Clicking on a listing should take users to that listing's page
    The listing page should show
        all details about the listing including
            the current price

    If the user is signed in,
        If the item is not on their watchlist
            Allow it to be added
        Else
            Allow it to be removed

        Allow user to bid on the item
        Bid must be >= starting bid && > current bid
            Show error otherwise

        If user is signed in && is the listing creator
            Allow them to be able to close the auction
                Which means highest bidder wins auction && makes listing inactive

        If user is signed in && is on a closed listing page && has won the auction
            Show message saying winning condition

        Signed in users should be able to make comments on listing page

        All comments should be shown on the listing page

WATCHLIST
    If user is signed in
        show link to a watchlist page which
            displays links to all the listings in that user's watchlist
            and clicking on any of them should go to the listing page

CATEGORIES
    Show links each category that takes to pages listing out all the listings of each category

DJANGO ADMIN INTERFACE
    Admin should be able to
        View
        Add
        Edit
        Delete
            any listings, comments, and bids
